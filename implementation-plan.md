# ERC-2771 Gasless Transaction System Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementation of a gasless transaction system using ERC-2771 where users can transfer USDT without holding ETH. The relayer service will execute transactions on behalf of users and receive USDT as payment.

## System Components

### 1. Smart Contracts

#### TokenPaymentForwarder Contract (extends MinimalForwarder)
```solidity
// Key additions to MinimalForwarder
struct TokenPaymentRequest {
    ForwardRequest request;     // Standard forward request
    address tokenAddress;       // USDT contract address
    uint256 paymentAmount;     // Amount of USDT to pay relayer
}
```

#### Modified ERC20 Contract (for USDT interactions)
- Implements ERC2771Context for meta-transaction support
- Includes approval checking for relayer payment

### 2. AWS Infrastructure

#### Message Queue (AWS SQS)
- Purpose: Queue meta-transactions for processing
- Configuration:
  - FIFO queue for ordered processing
  - Message retention: 24 hours
  - Visibility timeout: 5 minutes
  - Dead letter queue for failed transactions

#### Key Management (AWS KMS)
- Purpose: Secure storage and management of relayer's private keys
- Configuration:
  - Customer managed key
  - Automatic key rotation
  - Restricted access via IAM roles

#### Relayer Service (AWS Lambda)
- Purpose: Process meta-transactions and execute on-chain
- Configuration:
  - Runtime: Node.js 18.x
  - Memory: 1024 MB
  - Timeout: 60 seconds
  - VPC configuration for enhanced security

#### Monitoring (CloudWatch)
- Purpose: Monitor system health and transaction status
- Metrics:
  - Transaction success rate
  - Queue length
  - Processing time
  - Gas prices

### 3. Transaction Flow

1. User Signs Transaction
```typescript
interface MetaTransaction {
    to: string;              // Target contract
    data: string;            // Transaction data
    value: string;           // Transaction value (0 for token transfers)
    gas: string;            // Gas limit
    nonce: string;          // User's nonce
    tokenPayment: {
        token: string;      // USDT contract address
        amount: string;     // Payment amount
    }
}
```

2. Submit to Relayer
- HTTP endpoint backed by API Gateway
- Validates transaction format
- Enqueues to SQS

3. Transaction Processing
```typescript
async function processTransaction(event: SQSEvent) {
    // Verify USDT allowance
    // Execute meta-transaction
    // Collect USDT payment
    // Monitor gas prices
    // Handle failures
}
```

4. Payment Collection
- Check USDT allowance before execution
- Transfer USDT after successful execution
- Handle failed transfers

### 4. Security Considerations

1. Smart Contract Security
- Audit of TokenPaymentForwarder
- Rate limiting
- Emergency pause functionality
- Access control for admin functions

2. Infrastructure Security
- IAM roles and policies
- VPC configuration
- API Gateway authorization
- KMS key access control

3. Transaction Security
- Signature verification
- Nonce management
- Gas price limits
- Maximum payment amounts

### 5. Implementation Phases

Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- Deploy AWS resources using Terraform
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Configure security policies

Phase 2: Smart Contract Development
- Develop and test TokenPaymentForwarder
- Implement ERC2771Context integration
- Deploy to testnet

Phase 3: Relayer Service Development
- Implement transaction processing
- Add USDT payment handling
- Set up error handling and retries

Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
- Unit and integration testing
- Security audit
- Mainnet deployment

### 6. Cost Considerations

1. AWS Costs
- Lambda execution
- SQS message processing
- KMS key usage
- CloudWatch logs

2. On-chain Costs
- Gas fees for transaction execution
- Contract deployment
- Emergency operations

### 7. Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Operational Metrics
- Transaction success rate
- Average processing time
- USDT payment collection rate
- Gas price trends

2. Maintenance Tasks
- Key rotation
- Contract upgrades
- Performance optimization
- Gas price strategy updates
